Frame Buffer Objects

render1 is a simple example of rendering an image into a texture and then using this texture. The first step renders a Sierpinski gasket from Chapter 2 into a texture. The second part renderes a single rectangle and uses this texture image to fill it.

render2 adds a diffusion shader. First, we render the Sierpinski gasket into a texture and use this texture to fill a rectangle. We then add an idle function which does two things. First it diffuses this texture. Second it draws a randomly placed point. The idle function uses two textures and swaps between them so on each iteration there is a diffusion and a new point generated.
