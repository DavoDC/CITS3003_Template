In 2015, I put in quite a fair bit of effort tidying up the code
given by the author Angel. Most of my work was for the Linux version
of the code.  For some of the souce .cpp files, I put in comments
to help explain the code and I even added additional functionalities.
You should read those comments and try to understand the code at
your own time.

In 2016, I tidied up some of the code for the Mac version as well.

You should be able to compile and run most of the example programs
without major issues. For the Mac OS, you should use only the code
under the MAC_VERSIONS subdirectory. For Linux, you should use only
the code under the LINUX_VERSIONS subdirectory.

To compile, type:
    make

To clean up, type:
    make clobber
