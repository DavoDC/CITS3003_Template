Some exmples from Chapter 7.

chap07_6E_example1.c: rotating cube with checker board texture

chap07_6E_example2.c: rotating cube using a reflection map

chap07_6E_example3.c: bump map on one polygon with a rotation light

----------------------------------

I only managed to get example1 to work. Both example2 and example3
are too complicated.
