The examples in this directory show you how to have interactive menu.
In all the examples, clicking the middle mouse button should bring up
a menu. The user can select the limb of the robot to rotate. Clicking
the left or right mouse button would then rotate the selected limb.
If you encounter the problem that the text of the menu item is not
visible (this problem seems to affect only the Linux side), then
try to replace the glsl files by those supplied in the MAC_VERSIONS
directory.
