Examples from Chapter 5.

example1.cpp: generates wire frame approximation of a sphere by recursive subdivision of a tetrahedron

example2.cpp: animates a rotating cube with diffuse, specular and ambient lighting. Vertex shades
	are computed in the C++ code

example3.cpp: animates a rotating cube with lighting calculations done in the vertex shader

example6.cpp: shading of sphere model using true normals at vertices
