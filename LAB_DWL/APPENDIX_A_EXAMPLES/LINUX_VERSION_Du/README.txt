This directory contains cpp programs that are identical to those
in the CHAPTER* directories.

If any of the programs here does not work, then go back to the appropriate
CHAPTER directories as the code in those directories have been more thoroughly
tested and commented.

* Sierpinski triangle - iterative with random dots
    append_example_a2.cpp = CHAPTER02_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example1.cpp

* Sierpinski triangle - recursion with filled in triangles
    append_example_a3.cpp = CHAPTER02_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example1.cpp

* Spinning cube with different colours at the vertices. Spinning can be
controlled by clicking mouse buttons
    append_example_a4.cpp = CHAPTER03_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example6.cpp

* Stationary cube that can be rotated by a small angle by keyboard input.
This program shows the clipping of the perspective view volume defined by the
near and far clipping plane and other parameters. Involves calling LookAt()
and Perspective(). More interesting examples are in the
CHAPTER04_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS directory.
    append_example_a5.cpp = CHAPTER04_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example3.cpp

* Spinning cube with lighting and object materials.
    append_example_a6.cpp = CHAPTER05_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example3.cpp

* A sphere (modelled as 4096 triangles) with lighting and object materials.
    append_example_a7.cpp = CHAPTER05_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example6.cpp

* A spinning cube that can be interactively controlled by clicking the mouse
buttons. Each face of the cube has a texture pattern mapped onto it.
    append_example_a8.cpp is similar to CHAPTER07_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example1.cpp
except that the incremental angle of rotation has increased so the textured
cube in append_example_a8.cpp spins faster.

* A robot with different body parts modelled as rectangular polyhedrons.
Clicking the middle button will bring up a menu for selection of a body part.
Clicking the left or right button will rotate the selected body part.
    append_example_a9.cpp is similar to CHAPTER08_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example2.cpp

* A teapot displayed in wire-frame.
    append_example_a10.cpp = CHAPTER10_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example1.cpp

Interesting programs in the laboratories directory:

CHAPTER09_CODE/LINUX_VERSIONS/example1.cpp:
	Particles (little balls) bouncing inside a cube. Can interactively
	control the number of particiles, their speed, gravity, repulsion,
	etc. Clicking the middle mouse button to bring up a menu for 
	control this. Note that the original code from the author did not
	work. I managed to fix it with some effort.

EXTRAS directory:
	wave.cpp wave2.cpp etc
