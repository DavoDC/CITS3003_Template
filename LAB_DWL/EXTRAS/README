These subdirectories include some extra examples. Right now they are all Mac versions but converting any of them over to Windows or Mac Lion should be easy.

FBO contains two examples of the use of frame buffer objects for writing to texture memory and then using the technique interatively to do things like image processing.

WAVE contains a simple example of animating a rectangular mesh in the vertex shader.

WAVE2 is similar to WAVE one but outputs filled polygons instead of a wire frame. The shading is not quite right since the normals aren't preturbed.

NONPHOTO is a simple example of cartoon shading (non-photorealistic rendering) using two colors and diffuse lighting. The example is a lot nicer if you replace the cube with a curved surface such as the teapot.

MORPH is a demo of one triangle morphing into another. Two sets of vertex locations are sent to the shader. The shader interpolates between pairs of corresponding vertices using a sinusoidally varying time parameter.
